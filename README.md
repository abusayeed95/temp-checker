# Project: Weather App

This project was created with an free weather api. And for design I have used *Javascript, HTMLL5, CSS3, Bootstrap, etc.* You can searh for any city in this site. Then you'll get temperature of this city. You can also see the sunrise and sunset time.. To add nice visualisation and users satisfaction and reality I have used some images from API...
